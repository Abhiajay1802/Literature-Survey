# Cross-Modality Medical Image Translation Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a deep learning system capable of translating medical images between different modalities (specifically MRI to CT and vice versa) using unpaired image-to-image translation techniques. The primary goal is to enable the synthesis of one imaging modality from another, potentially reducing the need for multiple scans, decreasing radiation exposure, and lowering healthcare costs.

## Technical Approach
We will implement a CycleGAN architecture, which uses two generator networks and two discriminator networks to learn mappings between domains without paired training examples. This is particularly suitable for medical imaging where paired datasets are rare and difficult to obtain. We'll incorporate medical-specific adaptations to preserve anatomical structures and critical diagnostic features.

## Dataset Requirements
The project will utilize publicly available medical imaging datasets:
- For brain imaging: IXI dataset (Information eXtraction from Images) containing MRI scans
- For abdomen/thorax: The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) collections with both CT and MRI
- Preprocessing will include registration, intensity normalization, and cropping to focus on relevant anatomical regions

## Model Architecture
1. **Generator Networks**: U-Net-based architecture with skip connections to preserve spatial information
2. **Discriminator Networks**: PatchGAN discriminators that classify whether overlapping image patches are real or fake
3. **Loss Functions**:
   - Adversarial loss (to make translations look realistic)
   - Cycle consistency loss (to preserve content and structure)
   - Identity loss (to preserve details when input is already in the target domain)
   - Structural similarity loss (to maintain anatomical correctness)

## Implementation Details
- Framework: PyTorch with MONAI extensions for medical imaging
- Training approach: Progressive growing of networks from lower to higher resolutions
- Regularization techniques: Gradient penalty, spectral normalization
- Hardware requirements: GPU with at least 8GB VRAM (ideally)
- Training time estimate: 2-3 days on consumer GPUs, can be split across multiple sessions

## Evaluation Metrics
1. Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) to measure quality of generated images
2. Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) for structural preservation
3. Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) for image quality
4. Expert evaluation by radiologists (if available)
5. Segmentation accuracy using pre-trained segmentation models as proxy for clinical utility

## Challenges to Address
1. Maintaining diagnostic quality in synthesized images
2. Handling different tissue contrasts between modalities
3. Preserving small but clinically significant features
4. Ensuring anatomical consistency across generated images
5. Validating results without paired ground truth data

## Expected Deliverables
1. Working implementation of MRI-to-CT and CT-to-MRI translation models
2. Quantitative evaluation of translation quality
3. Visual comparison of real vs. translated images
4. Analysis of preservation of clinically relevant features
5. Web application demo for image upload and translation (optional)
6. Ablation studies showing impact of different loss components

## Applications and Impact
The successful completion of this project could enable:
1. Reduction in radiation exposure by substituting some CT scans with MRI-derived synthetic CTs
2. Cost savings by eliminating redundant scans
3. Improved planning for radiation therapy using synthetic CTs from MRI
4. Data augmentation for other medical imaging AI systems
5. Foundation for future work in cross-modality synthesis

## Timeline and Milestones
1. Data collection and preprocessing (2 weeks)
2. Initial CycleGAN implementation (3 weeks)
3. Medical-specific adaptations and optimization (3 weeks)
4. Evaluation and validation (2 weeks)
5. Documentation and final report (2 weeks)

### Steps to add more papers:

- Clone the repository:  
  
```copy
git clone https://github.com/abhi9ab/Literature-Survey.git
```

- Create a branch:  
  
```copy
git branch -M main
```

- Add your findings in the appropriate Literature-Survey sub folders, i.e, "Papers" contains the actual survey papers, and "General Overview" contains the summaries with citations. Here is the prompt to get the General Overview:
  
```copy
I am assigned the task of a literature survey. I have gathered some papers related to the topics mentioned in the project. I have attached a paper. You need to analyse it, check if it is relevant to my project, and give a comprehensive paper summary. Also, give the citation in an IEEE format.
```

- Stage, Commit, and Push your work  

1. Add  
   
```copy
git add .
```
2. Commit  
   
```copy
git commit -m "Add Message"
```
3. Push  
   
```copy
git push -u origin main
