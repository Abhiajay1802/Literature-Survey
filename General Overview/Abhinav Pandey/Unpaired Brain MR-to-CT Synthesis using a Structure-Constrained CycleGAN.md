### üîç Objective

To generate structurally consistent synthetic CT images from unpaired MR images using a **Structure-Constrained CycleGAN**. The work introduces:

- A novel **structure-consistency loss** based on the **Modality Independent Neighborhood Descriptor (MIND)**
- A **position-based slice selection strategy** for better training efficiency and anatomical correspondence

### üß† Methodologies and Innovations

#### ‚úÖ 1. CycleGAN Backbone:
Two generators (G<sub>CT</sub>, G<sub>MR</sub>) and two discriminators (D<sub>CT</sub>, D<sub>MR</sub>) to learn bidirectional mappings between CT and MR domains using unpaired data.

#### ‚úÖ 2. Structure-Consistency Loss:
Addresses the limitation of conventional CycleGAN where structural fidelity is not enforced.

The **MIND feature** captures self-similarity in non-local patches around each voxel, invariant to modality.

**MIND feature for voxel x:**
```
F_x^(\alpha)(I) = \frac{1}{Z} \exp\left( -\frac{DP(I, x, x+\alpha)}{V(I, x)} \right)
```
Where:
- _Z_ = normalization constant
- _DP_ = patch distance:  
```
DP(I, x, x+\alpha) = \sum_{p \in P} (I(x + p) - I(x + \alpha + p))^2
```
- _V(I, x)_ = local variance:
```
V(I, x) = \frac{1}{4} \sum_{n \in N} DP(I, x, x + n)
```

Final **Structure-Consistency Loss**:
```
L_structure = (1/N_{MR}|R_{nl}|) \sum_x \| F_x(G_{CT}(I_{MR})) - F_x(I_{MR}) \|_1
            + (1/N_{CT}|R_{nl}|) \sum_x \| F_x(G_{MR}(I_{CT})) - F_x(I_{CT}) \|_1
```

#### ‚úÖ 3. Training Loss:
```
L_total = L_GAN + \lambda_1 * L_cycle + \lambda_2 * L_structure
```

Where:
- \( \lambda_1 = 10 \)
- \( \lambda_2 = 5 \)

#### ‚úÖ 4. Position-Based Slice Selection:
Aligns training slices by anatomical position to improve learning stability:
```
T(i) = \left[ \frac{i \cdot (K_{CT} - 1)}{K_{MR} - 1} \right] + m
```
Where m is a random offset in [‚àí5, 5].

### üìä Experimental Setup and Results

- **Dataset:** 45 clinical brain MR and CT volumes
- **Training/Validation/Test:** 27 / 3 / 15 patients
- **Metrics Used:**
  - MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
  - PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio)
  - SSIM (Structural Similarity Index)
  - SSIM(HG): SSIM in high gradient regions (e.g., bone)

#### ‚ö° Quantitative Results (Average over 15 test subjects):
| Method             | MAE ‚Üì | PSNR ‚Üë | SSIM ‚Üë | SSIM(HG) ‚Üë |
|--------------------|---------|----------|------------|---------------|
| CycleGAN           | 150.3   | 23.09    | 0.732      | 0.546         |
| CycleGAN (PBS)     | 147.0   | 23.29    | 0.740      | 0.592         |
| CycleGAN (paired)  | 122.7   | 24.57    | 0.785      | 0.630         |
| **Proposed Method**| **129.0** | **24.15** | **0.779**  | **0.617**     |

- Proposed model significantly outperforms vanilla CycleGAN (p < 0.001)
- Comparable to a CycleGAN trained with paired data

### ‚õî Challenges Addressed
- Structural inconsistencies in conventional CycleGAN-generated images
- Lack of paired data availability in clinical scenarios
- Mode collapse from random unaligned training slices

---

### ‚ùì Challenges Left for Future Work
- Extension to 3D volumetric GANs (this work uses 2D slices)
- Domain adaptation across scanners and populations
- Integration of attention mechanisms or multi-modal input features
- Real-time performance optimization for clinical deployment

---

### üî¨ Contributions and Clinical Impact
- First method to enforce structural similarity using a descriptor (MIND) without ground-truth segmentation
- Introduced simple yet effective training strategy (PBS)
- Can potentially reduce patient CT scans in radiotherapy planning
