### 🔍 Objective

The paper presents **DC-cycleGAN**, an improved CycleGAN architecture for **unpaired CT-to-MR and MR-to-CT image synthesis**. It addresses structural preservation and training instability by integrating novel loss functions such as **Dual Contrast (DC) loss**, **SSIM**, and **Cross-Entropy**.

### 🧠 Methodologies and Innovations

#### ✅ 1. Dual Contrast Loss
Introduced to the discriminator to penalize similarity between fake images and source domain inputs, improving modality distinction.

#### ✅ 2. Cross-Entropy Loss (Discriminator)
Used in place of MSE for better convergence and stronger gradients during adversarial training.

#### ✅ 3. SSIM Loss (Generator)
Promotes perceptual similarity and preserves image structure during translation.

#### ✅ 4. Modified Cycle Consistency Loss
```math
L_{scycle}(G, F) = (1 - SSIM(F(G(x)), x)) + (1 - SSIM(G(F(y)), y))
```

#### ✅ 5. Total Objective Function
```math
L = L_{GAN}(G, D_Y) + L_{GAN}(F, D_X) + β(L_{DC}(D_Y) + L_{DC}(D_X)) + λL_{scycle}
```
Where λ = 10 (cycle loss), β = 0.5 (DC loss).

### 🧪 Data Preprocessing and Dataset

#### ⚙️ Dataset Used:
- Public dataset by Han et al. (2017)
- **100 slice pairs** selected from CT/MR images (after removing artifacts)
  - 90 for training, 10 for testing

#### 🔄 Preprocessing Steps:
- Removal of stereotactic frames from CT images
- Resized all slices to **256×256 pixels**
- Normalized to intensity range **[–1, 1]**
- Repeated training 10 times to report stable average performance

### 📊 Experimental Setup and Evaluation

- **Training:** 200 epochs, batch size = 1
- **Metrics:** SSIM, MAE, PSNR

#### 📈 Quantitative Results
- **MR synthesis**:-
| Method         | MAE ↓  | PSNR ↑  | SSIM ↑  |
|----------------|--------|---------|---------|
| RegGAN         | 0.168  | 18.67   | 0.680   |
| CycleGAN       | 0.091  | 20.63   | 0.716   |
| NICE-GAN       | 0.081  | 21.44   | 0.703   |
| DualGAN        | 0.080  | 22.85   | 0.740   |
| **DC-cycleGAN**| **0.045** | **26.69** | **0.826** |

### ⛔ Challenges Addressed

- **Unpaired data limitation:** Enables high-quality synthesis without aligned image pairs.
- **Low discriminator sensitivity:** DC loss improves separation between synthetic and source domains.
- **Poor perceptual quality:** Replacing MSE with SSIM and CE improves structure preservation and training stability.

---

### ❓ Challenges Left for Future Work

- **No 3D context:** Operates only on 2D slices; lacks volumetric continuity.
- **No attention mechanism:** Could miss small structures critical in diagnosis.
- **Limited generalization:** Evaluation limited to a small, curated dataset.

---

### 🔬 Contributions and Clinical Impact

- Proposes **dual contrast loss** for robust domain separation in GANs.
- Achieves **SOTA performance** for both CT-to-MR and MR-to-CT synthesis.
- Reduces dependency on dual-modality imaging, useful in radiation therapy and diagnostic planning.

### 🔗 Relevance to Our Project

- **Dual Contrast Loss** can help improve discriminator learning by distinguishing both modality and domain, which aligns with our goal of MR-to-CT conversion.
- **SSIM & CE-based Losses** offer a path to improve perceptual quality in synthetic CT output.
- **Baseline Benchmarking**: The strong empirical evaluation gives us solid reference points to measure our own model’s performance.
