### üîç Objective

The aim of the research is to generate high-quality T2-weighted (T2W) MRI images from T1-weighted (T1W) MRI images using a modified CycleGAN. 
The novelty lies in introducing the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) into the loss function to improve the perceptual and structural realism of the synthesized images. 
This is especially important in clinical settings where precise structural representation is crucial.

### üß† Methodologies and Innovations

#### ‚úÖ 1. SSIM-CycleGAN Architecture:
A modified CycleGAN model is used with two generators and two discriminators. The generators are based on U-Net architectures and are responsible for translating T1W to T2W images and vice versa. Discriminators follow a PatchGAN configuration to evaluate the realism of image patches rather than the entire image, helping preserve fine texture.

#### ‚úÖ 2. Loss Functions:
To better preserve image structure and quality, the following loss components are used:

- **Identity Loss:** Ensures the generator behaves like an identity function when given images from the target domain.
- **SSIM Loss:** Enforces perceptual similarity, encouraging better luminance, contrast, and structural integrity.
- **GAN Generator and Discriminator Losses:** Standard adversarial losses that drive the generator to create realistic images.
- **Cycle Consistency Loss:** Maintains that converting an image to another domain and back yields the original image.
- **Total Loss Function:** Combines all above components using weights (Œª) to balance each contribution.

### üß™ Data Preprocessing and Datasets

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Datasets Used:
- **BraTS 2019:** Contains multi-modal brain tumor MR images, widely used for brain image synthesis and segmentation tasks.
- **IXI Dataset:** Includes T1 and T2 MR images collected from normal subjects, useful for general brain synthesis tasks.

#### üîÑ Preprocessing Steps:
Preprocessing is critical due to varying image resolutions, intensities, and orientations:
- **Normalization:** Each image is normalized using:
  ```
  normalized_image = (image - mean) / std
  ```
  This step standardizes image intensities for consistent network input.
- **Resizing:** All MR slices are resized to 256x256 pixels.
- **Data Splitting:** The dataset is split into 80% training and 20% testing.
- **Unpaired Setup:** T1W and T2W images are not necessarily from the same subject but are statistically matched.

### üìä Experimental Setup

The model was trained over 250 epochs using a batch size of 16. The Adam optimizer was employed to stabilize GAN training. Image size was consistently set to 256x256.
