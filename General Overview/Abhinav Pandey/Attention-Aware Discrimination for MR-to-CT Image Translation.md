### 🔍 Objective

The study aims to improve the quality of MR-to-CT image translation using unpaired datasets by introducing an **attention-aware CycleGAN (A-CycleGAN)**. The model incorporates **attention-gated discriminators** and **variational autoencoder (VAE) enhancement** to stabilize training and improve focus on relevant anatomical structures.

### 🧠 Methodologies and Innovations

#### ✅ 1. Attention-Aware Discriminators:
Introduces attention gates into PatchGAN-style discriminators to help them focus on anatomically important regions of the image and reduce irrelevant noise.

#### ✅ 2. Variational Autoencoder (VAE) Enhancement:
VAE modules are integrated into the discriminator to stabilize training, allow deeper architectures, and support convergence in adversarial settings.

#### ✅ 3. CycleGAN Backbone:
A standard unpaired CycleGAN structure is used with two generators and two discriminators for bidirectional MR ↔ CT translation.

#### ✅ 4. Loss Functions:
- **Adversarial Loss:** Encourages realistic outputs  
- **Cycle Consistency Loss:** Enforces reversibility of translations  
- **VAE Reconstruction Loss:** Stabilizes discriminator learning

### 🧪 Data Preprocessing and Dataset

#### ⚙️ Dataset Used:
- **90 patients** with head, neck, and brain cancers undergoing radiotherapy  
  - 60 patients (4,138 axial slices) used for training and validation  
  - 30 patients (1,422 slices) used as the hold-out test set

#### 🔄 Preprocessing Steps:
- Images were **normalized** (mean subtraction and std division)  
- All volumes were rescaled to **1×1×2 mm** spacing (isotropic voxel alignment)  
- Slices were extracted from 3D volumes and resized to **256×256 pixels**  
- Augmentation included random flipping, cropping, and histogram renormalization

### 📊 Experimental Setup and Evaluation

- **Training Setup:** Mini-batch size of 2, trained for 600 epochs using two NVIDIA GTX 1080 Ti GPUs  
- **Optimizer:** Adam optimizer, fixed learning rate for 10 epochs, then linear decay  
- **Metrics Used:**
  - **PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio)**
  - **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**
  - **SSIM (Structural Similarity Index)**

#### 🧪 Evaluation Results (Hold-out Set, n = 30):

| Model        | PSNR ↑   | MAE ↓     | SSIM ↑   |
|--------------|----------|-----------|----------|
| U-Net        | 54.67    | 26.12     | 0.672    |
| GAN          | 58.81    | 23.32     | 0.712    |
| CycleGAN     | 61.58    | 21.34     | 0.742    |
| **A-CycleGAN** | **62.35** | **19.61** | **0.778** |

Statistically significant improvements were observed for MAE and SSIM (p < 0.05).

### ⛔ Challenges Addressed

- **Limited Focus of Discriminators:**  
  Traditional GAN discriminators treat all image regions equally, leading to poor translation of anatomically critical areas. The attention mechanism helps focus on those key regions.

- **Instability in Training GANs:**  
  Adding attention can make training unstable due to gradients flowing through many network paths. The VAE helps mitigate this by regularizing and smoothing the discriminator’s learning.

- **Need for Unpaired Training:**  
  The model avoids reliance on paired datasets, which are hard to obtain clinically, while still achieving high accuracy using unpaired inputs.

---

### ❓ Challenges Left for Future Work

- **Generalization to Other Anatomical Regions:**  
  Since the dataset focused on head and neck, it’s unclear how well the model generalizes to other parts of the body.

- **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:**  
  Training remains highly sensitive to learning rates, attention gate thresholds, and batch size. Fine-tuning these requires experience and trial.

- **Input Size Limitation:**  
  The model was trained on 256×256 slices. Higher resolutions may be needed for full-detail clinical deployment, requiring more memory and compute power.

### 🔬 Contributions and Clinical Impact

- First implementation of **attention-aware discriminator with VAE** for medical GANs  
- Potential to improve MR-only workflows in radiotherapy and eliminate redundant CT scans  
- Encourages fine-grained anatomical translation in synthetic images

---

### 🔗 Relevance to Our Project
- **Attention Mechanism:** Provides inspiration for focusing synthesis on key structures (e.g., skull, soft tissues), especially useful for CT generation where bone detail is critical.

- **VAE Enhancement:** The idea of stabilizing GAN training with VAE support is valuable for our own CycleGAN, which may benefit from more stable convergence and deeper networks.

- **Evaluation Strategy:** Their metric-driven comparison (with statistical testing) guides how we should benchmark our model against baseline GANs and CycleGANs.
