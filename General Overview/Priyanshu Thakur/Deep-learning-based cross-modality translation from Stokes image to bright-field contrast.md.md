**Authors:** Shilong Wei, Lu Si, Tongyu Huang, Shan Du, Yue Yao, Yang Dong, and Hui Ma  
**Published in:** _Journal of Biomedical Optics_, October 2023  
**DOI:** 10.1117/1.JBO.28.10.102911

#### **Objective**

The paper proposes a deep learning framework using CycleGAN to enable the **cross-modality translation of Stokes images (from Mueller Matrix Microscopy)** into **bright-field microscopy images** of pathological tissue samples. This has significant implications for clinical diagnostics by reducing the need for multiple imaging systems and chemical staining.

### üß† **Key Contributions**

1. **CycleGAN for Medical Imaging**:
    
    - Used to bypass the need for **pixel-aligned image pairs**, which is often impractical in medical settings.
        
    - Supports **unpaired image translation**, essential for training with adjacent tissue slides (e.g., different IHC stains).
        
2. **Robust Against Imaging Artifacts**:
    
    - Stokes images are **independent of illumination variation and image registration**, improving stability over Mueller Matrix (MM) images.
        
3. **Domain-specific Evaluations**:
    
    - Quantitative metrics like **SSIM, RMSE, JSD**, and **EMD** are used to evaluate translation performance.
        
    - Qualitative validation by **radiologists** and domain experts shows accurate preservation of pathological features.
        
4. **Transfer Learning Usage**:
    
    - Demonstrated transfer learning from liver to breast tissue for faster convergence and better generalizability.
        
5. **Computational Staining**:
    
    - Extended the model to **simulate immunohistochemistry (IHC)** staining from H&E-stained tissue using unpaired translation‚Äîanalogous to generating synthetic CT from MRI.

### üß™ **Methodology**

- **Input**: Polarimetric Stokes images (S0‚ÄìS3) captured in a single shot.
    
- **Output**: Bright-field microscopy images of H&E and IHC-stained tissues.
    
- **Model**: Standard **CycleGAN** architecture with:
    
    - **U-Net-like ResNet generators** (with skip connections)
        
    - **PatchGAN discriminators**
        
- **Training**:
    
    - 100 epochs
        
    - Image patches of 256x256
        
    - Mixed-resolution data (4√ó and 20√ó magnifications)
        
    - Evaluated on liver, breast, and lung tissue datasets

### üìà **Results & Performance**

- Achieved **comparable or better results using Stokes images** than MM images, with lower acquisition time and reduced preprocessing.
    
- Model is **robust to changes in resolution and polarization state**.
    
- **Real-time inference (~0.1s per image)** was demonstrated on standard hardware (2x RTX 2080Ti).
