### 🎯 Objective
Propose an **unsupervised domain adaptation** method to transfer segmentation models trained on a labeled source domain (e.g., MRI) to an unlabeled target domain (e.g., CT) using adversarial learning strategies.

---

### 🧠 Methodologies & Innovations

1. **Domain Adaptation using Adversarial Loss**  
   - Adds a discriminator to distinguish feature maps from source and target.
   - Forces encoder to produce domain-invariant feature representations.

2. **Two-Stage Learning Strategy**  
   - Pre-train on source domain with supervised segmentation loss.
   - Fine-tune encoder with adversarial domain adaptation loss.

3. **Minimal Target Domain Data Assumption**  
   - No target labels required for adaptation.

### 🧪 Data Preprocessing

1. **Normalization**  
   - MRI and CT intensities normalized separately between \([0,1]\).

2. **Resizing**  
   - Standard resolution fixed (e.g., 256×256).

3. **Augmentation**  
   - Random crops, elastic deformation, rotation applied during training.
