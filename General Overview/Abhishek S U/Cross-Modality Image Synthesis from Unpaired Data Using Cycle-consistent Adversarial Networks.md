### üéØ **Objective**  
To perform **unsupervised cross-modality adaptation** for medical image segmentation by learning **modality-invariant representations** using a CNN encoder-decoder structure enhanced with **adversarial domain adaptation**.  
Target: Translate features learned from **MRI** to be applicable on **CT** (and vice versa) for segmentation, without labeled CT data.

---

### üß† **Methodologies & Innovations**

- **Adversarial Feature Learning**: Introduces a discriminator to distinguish source (MRI) from target (CT) domain features.
- **Dual Encoder-Decoder Framework**: Only source data is labeled; target domain relies on learned feature alignment.
- **Unsupervised Adaptation Loss**: Forces target domain features to mimic the source domain‚Äôs statistical characteristics.
- **Patch-Level Discriminator**: Discriminator works on features, not images, improving generalization.

### üß™ **Data Preprocessing**

#### 1. **Z-Score Normalization**  
Standardizes each scan slice:  
\[
I_{\text{norm}} = \frac{I - \mu}{\sigma}
\]  
Where \( \mu \) and \( \sigma \) are the mean and standard deviation of the slice.

#### 2. **Histogram Matching**  
To reduce modality shift between CT and MRI:  
\[
I_{\text{matched}} = \text{CDF}^{-1}_{\text{ref}}(\text{CDF}_{\text{input}}(I))
\]

#### 3. **Resizing & Cropping**  
All slices are resized to a fixed dimension (e.g., 256√ó256) and center-cropped.

#### 4. **Data Augmentation**  
Includes flipping, rotation, and Gaussian noise to improve domain generalization.

### üìà **Evaluation Metrics**

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) | Measures overlap between predicted and ground truth masks |
| Hausdorff Distance (HD) | Measures boundary error between segmentation contours |
| Precision/Recall | Standard segmentation metrics to evaluate false positives/negatives |
| Domain Classifier Accuracy | How distinguishable the features are across domains (lower is better) |

---

### üß© **Challenges Addressed**

- **No paired data** between MRI and CT scans  
- MRI and CT have vastly different tissue contrasts and artifacts  
- Labeling is available only for MRI ‚Üí Need to generalize to CT  
- Avoid domain overfitting and improve **generalizability**

---

### üìå **Impact & Limitations**

#### ‚úÖ Impact:
- Demonstrates how **unlabeled CT scans** can be segmented using only MRI-based labeled training.
- Reduces clinical burden of annotating each modality individually.
- Opens door for low-resource hospitals to use pretrained models cross-modally.

#### ‚ùå Limitations:
- Fails to explicitly reconstruct synthetic images (no image-to-image translation).
- Evaluation limited to **brain datasets**.
- Sensitive to discriminator overfitting.
